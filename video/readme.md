This video provides a hands-on walkthrough of setting up and configuring ServiceNow, aligned with your key topics:
Instance provisioning
Update sets
Table creation
Form layout & design
Number maintenance
Process flow configurations
Client scripting
Set up Instance
Sign in to your ServiceNow Developer account, activate necessary plugins, and confirm the release version.

Start an Update Set
Navigate: System Update Sets â†’ Local Update Sets â†’ Select/Create â†’ Mark as Current.

Create a Table
Go to System Definition â†’ Tables â†’ New â†’ Enter label/name â†’ Extend if needed â†’ Save â†’ Add fields.

Configure Form Layout
Open a table record â†’ Right-click header â†’ Configure â†’ Form Layout â†’ Drag fields/sections.

Design Form (UI Builder)
Use UI Builder/Workspace/Form Designer to add tabs, widgets, and style layout.

Define Number Maintenance
Navigate to System Definition â†’ Number Maintenance â†’ Define a new numbering rule.

Design Workflow/Flow
Open Flow Designer â†’ New flow â†’ Add trigger, actions, approvals, conditions.

Write Client Scripts
Visit System Definition â†’ Client Scripts â†’ Choose trigger type (onLoad/onChange/etc) â†’ Use g_form to control UI behavior (visibility, mandatory fields, etc).

ðŸ“˜ Best Practices
Name update sets clearly (e.g. SchoolProj_xxx_v1)

Document table schema and field purposes

Use UI policies vs. Client Scripts: Use policies for simple logic, scripts for advanced operations

Test numbering rules thoroughly

Flow Designer offers more maintainability than legacy workflows

Comment your client scripts to aid future debugging and clarity

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
By the end of the video and this guide, you will have:

A custom table with configured form layout and numbering

A defined process flow automating key tasks

Client scripting enforcing UI logic, validations, and interactivity

All changes captured within an Update Set, ready for packaging or promotion
